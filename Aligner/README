CMUSphinx Long Audio Aligner
----------------------------
To compile and run the current version of long audio aligner, we recommend using ANT.

To run the demo, you may edit /resource/batchFile.txt with entries indicating path to your
text and audio files that are to be aligned.
<path/to/text/file.txt> SPACE/TAB <path/to/audio/file>


The jars must be present under ./lib for successful compilation of the code. The wav audio
file must be present in ./resource/wav and the text file in ./resource/transcription/

Instructions to complile and run the code:
 > ant all


POINTS OF CAUTION TO USER

 * Make sure your audio file and acoustic model are compatible before actual alignment.
 * Text and audio can differ by small amounts (small is relative, I leave it to user to realise 
   that by re-peated usage).

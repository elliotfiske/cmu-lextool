../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_06_verne_64kb-1010.mfc a number of fishing smacks and coasting boats
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_13_verne_64kb-0330.mfc i think we must wait till night before acting
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_14_verne_64kb-0720.mfc a large mantle
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_18_verne_64kb-0190.mfc the steamer was forced to proceed slowly and the captain estimated that she would reach hong kong twenty hours behind time
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_19_verne_64kb-1850.mfc replied passepartout again emptying his glass
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_20_verne_64kb-1730.mfc very well in half an hour we shall go on board
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_20_verne_64kb-2190.mfc the sails and the english flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_21_verne_64kb-2450.mfc though the waves crossed each other and imparted shocks and counter shocks
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_22_verne_64kb-0370.mfc just as the carnatic was moving off
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_25_verne_64kb-0200.mfc passepartout in his joy on reaching at last the american continent
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_28_verne_64kb-1080.mfc on the steamers
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_31_verne_64kb-0120.mfc seriously sir are you in great haste
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_31_verne_64kb-1460.mfc the creeks it passed over were not perceived
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_33_verne_64kb-1220.mfc if the wind failed them they might still count on the steam
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_33_verne_64kb-1650.mfc it was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_33_verne_64kb-2120.mfc that is near the whole value of the craft
../../../librivox-feats/around_world_in_80_days_34_verne_64kb-0110.mfc would have fallen upon fix had he not been held back by some policemen
../../../librivox-feats/blockaderunners_04_verne_64kb-1950.mfc you will never guess what the captain has proposed to me
../../../librivox-feats/blockaderunners_04_verne_64kb-2400.mfc you are going to brave many dangers
../../../librivox-feats/blockaderunners_08_verne_64kb-3280.mfc get in quick
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_03_wells_64kb-2300.mfc in which the paste is heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_04_wells_64kb-0110.mfc and the stillness of the twilight was upon everything
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_08_wells_64kb-0680.mfc and down the crack of each of them showed a minute line of yellowish green
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_09_wells_64kb-0270.mfc that's easy
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_09_wells_64kb-1190.mfc i can stand this
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_11_wells_64kb-1470.mfc louder grew this throbbing and beating
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_12_wells_64kb-0270.mfc this startled me very much
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_13_wells_64kb-0700.mfc his voice had the interest now of a man who has discerned a pretty sequence of reasoning
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_21_wells_64kb-3230.mfc all the same i'm tremendously obliged to you you know
../../../librivox-feats/first_men_in_moon_23_wells_64kb-2790.mfc it's pressure increases
../../../librivox-feats/master_of_world_03_verne_64kb-0590.mfc not a suspicious noise has come down to us

../../../librivox-feats/master_of_world_11_verne_64kb-2950.mfc in the darkness we three would have been helpless without the guidance of wells
../../../librivox-feats/master_of_world_14_verne_64kb-0160.mfc in each of it's transformations must be worked by rotary engines
../../../librivox-feats/master_of_world_15_verne_64kb-1950.mfc yes this idea more and more took possession of me
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_02_verne_64kb-1910.mfc and in that way reach the secessionist camp
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_03_verne_64kb-0340.mfc a thick fog made the night very dark
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_06_verne_64kb-3030.mfc and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_08_verne_64kb-3500.mfc it's various productions were impressed on his mind
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_09_verne_64kb-1550.mfc well
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_10_verne_64kb-2620.mfc before taking any rest
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_12_verne_64kb-0860.mfc and he doesn't bark
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_12_verne_64kb-2690.mfc regular american rabbits with long ears jaws armed on each side with five molars
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_13_verne_64kb-2050.mfc the fuel made of well prepared fagots
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_17_verne_64kb-1840.mfc which were pursued with more than zeal
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_18_verne_64kb-1850.mfc but a perpendicular well into which it was impossible to venture
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_21_verne_64kb-0850.mfc asked pencroft
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_1_21_verne_64kb-1730.mfc replied herbert
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_01_verne_64kb-1640.mfc and one day
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_09_verne_64kb-2130.mfc and he pointed to a shrub rather than a tree
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_09_verne_64kb-2540.mfc which neb soon transformed into cakes and puddings
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_10_verne_64kb-2160.mfc in the meanwhile the monster thus stranded did not move
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_11_verne_64kb-0720.mfc could not but cause him some anxiety
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_14_verne_64kb-2610.mfc the prisoner did not struggle
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_16_verne_64kb-0900.mfc said gideon spilett
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_16_verne_64kb-2310.mfc thus he lived in the same manner as when he had no other shelter than the forests tabor island
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_18_verne_64kb-0710.mfc top's adventure and lastly this bottle
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_2_19_verne_64kb-2290.mfc uttered barks which were repeated by the thousand echoes of the basaltic cliff
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_3_01_verne_64kb-4220.mfc but he felt that the safety of the colony
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_3_02_verne_64kb-3310.mfc but was flight still possible
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_3_04_verne_64kb-0480.mfc they had fled into the interior of the island
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_3_04_verne_64kb-4100.mfc but it was there
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_3_09_verne_64kb-3120.mfc called up all his energy
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_3_13_verne_64kb-2360.mfc goats and musmons gambolled among the rocks
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_3_14_verne_64kb-2920.mfc it was therefore lower in temperature than the preceding winter
../../../librivox-feats/mysterious_island_3_19_verne_64kb-2500.mfc because it was not replenished
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_01_austen_64kb-0610.mfc an earnest desire of having his own way
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_03_austen_64kb-0100.mfc by melancholy remembrances
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_06_austen_64kb-0850.mfc but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_12_austen_64kb-1610.mfc the idea however started by her
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_13_austen_64kb-2000.mfc to enter the house while missis smith was in it
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_14_austen_64kb-0830.mfc his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_20_austen_64kb-0600.mfc for we know all about it i assure you
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_20_austen_64kb-1050.mfc he is always out of humour
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_21_austen_64kb-3250.mfc either in curiosity after petty information or in a disposition to communicate it
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_22_austen_64kb-2690.mfc sometimes
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_25_austen_64kb-0050.mfc sense and sensibility
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_27_austen_64kb-2160.mfc and though expressing satisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_29_austen_64kb-3220.mfc my feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_30_austen_64kb-1790.mfc and what does talking ever do you know
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_33_austen_64kb-1140.mfc what do you mean
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_34_austen_64kb-1670.mfc which was the comparative heights of harry dashwood
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_36_austen_64kb-0900.mfc to a small musical party at her house
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_36_austen_64kb-2740.mfc cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_37_austen_64kb-2440.mfc i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_39_austen_64kb-0240.mfc this would not in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy of miss dashwood
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_40_austen_64kb-0940.mfc how she should express herself in her note to edward
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_44_austen_64kb-0440.mfc elinor would not speak
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_44_austen_64kb-1750.mfc and my feelings blameless
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_44_austen_64kb-2610.mfc in my present visit
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_44_austen_64kb-3930.mfc yet she felt it her duty check such ideas in her companion as the last
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_44_austen_64kb-6970.mfc as to that
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_45_austen_64kb-0120.mfc widely differing in themselves
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_45_austen_64kb-0970.mfc the reward of her sister was due
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_46_austen_64kb-3070.mfc no
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_47_austen_64kb-0400.mfc missis dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness
../../../librivox-feats/sense_and_sensibility_49_austen_64kb-0710.mfc as i had no friend no companion in my brother

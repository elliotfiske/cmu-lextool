ABOUT
-----
Speech and text alignment finds applications in fields such as multimedia indexing 
and training of large vocabulary speech recognition. This project is designed to provide
this functionality in CMUSphinx's Sphinx4 decoder.

Result of a typical audio - text alignment is a sequence of word indexed with their start
and end time in the audio.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
i) JDK version >= 1.6.x.x
ii) Sphinx4.jar 

RUN INSTRUCTIONS
----------------
To run the demo :

i) Edit /resource/batchFile.txt with entries indicating path to your text and audio files 
that are to be aligned.
path/to/text/file.txt <SPACE/TAB> path/to/audio/file

ii) Run the code using ANT build by issuing command:
	$ ant all

UNDERSTANDING THE RESULT OF ALIGNMENT
-------------------------------------
Result of alignment is displayed on standard output as well as corresponding file* in ./TimedOutput/
Result will contain of a sequence of words, each followed by it's start and end time in the utterance 
as detected by Long Audio aligner.
Eg. Sphinx(1.01,1.37) :- Word detected  : Sphinx
			 Start Time	: 1.01 sec
			 End Time	: 1.37 sec

POINTS OF CAUTION TO USER
-------------------------

 * Make sure your audio file and acoustic model are compatible before actual alignment.
 * Text and audio can differ by small amounts (small is relative, I leave it to user to realise 
   that by repeated usage).

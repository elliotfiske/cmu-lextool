You will need SWIG, Apache Ant and Android NDK to build a distributable
archive of pocketsphinx for Android.

Make sure this directory is in the same parent directory as sphinxbase and
pocketsphinx are. You can download them from http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/.

Specify a valid path to Android NDK in 'build.properties'.

Run `ant jar`. If everything goes right, you will get
'pocketsphinx-android.jar' without 'build' directory. This should contain
compiled wrapper classes as well as dynamically linked libraries with the
pockesphinx code.

Copy the built archive to `libs` directory of your Android project and the
build script will automatically include it in the project binary.

This tool can be used to create Finite State Transducers from hyperstrings and
language models. These are actually Finite State Automata with the same input
and output labels for transitions.

The results can be written to file for further usage: a file with the
transitions and two files for the symbols (input/output and states).

These files can be used for capitalization and punctuation recovery by composing
a hyperstring FST with a punctuated and capitalized Language Model.

The Language Model has to be trained from a text containing capitalized text and
punctuation normalized as <COMMA> and <PERIOD>. Whitespaces have to be
represented by <NONE>.

The resulted FSTs from hyperstring and language model have to be composed
(OpenFst can be used). A shortest-path tool can be the used to output the
capitalized and punctuated string.

To compile the script used 'make' command in the root of the branch. The bash
scripts in the scripts/ folder can be used:

sh ./scrips/hyperstring2fst.sh -text t -path output_path 
sh ./scripts/lm2fst.sh -lm lm_path -path output_path 
sh ./scripts/generateFST.sh -text t -lm lm_path -path output_path

The hyperstring2fst and lm2fst scrips will create the .fst.txt and individual
isyms and ssyms files, and the generateFST scripts will create the .fst.txt
files and identical isyms and ssyms files for composition.

This is the main folder for Text-independent pronunciation evaluation system:

1. Use calc_statistics.py to calculate statistics for any data 

2. Here, I used TIMIT database to do so and check TIMIT_statistics.txt

3. Use test_phrase_random_feedback.py to get the score

4. Note: To use these scripts, you should have already done the alignment and its output ready

Thanks

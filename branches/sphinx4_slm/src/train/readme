This is an introduction to set up a basic experiment to get the WER for a new data set

1. Get a test data set
    Basically, you need audio files and coresponding trainscripts
2. convert the files into wav format.  If they are mp3, you can use the following script. Before running it, you need to change $path to your own audio folder
    $ ./mp2wav.sh	
3. recognition them using the demo transcriber, using
	First, you need to make some changes of the config file for the demo transcriber (.\src\apps\edu\cmu\sphinx\demo\transcriber\config.xml); usually, you only need to change the location of the trigramModel
	Secondly, build sphinx4. Go the main folder of sphinx4 and run
	$ ant
	Thirdly, run the scripts (change the path in rec.sh first)
	$ ./rec.sh
4. Get WER
	Download word_align.py from https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/trunk/SphinxTrain/scripts/decode/word_align.py
	Run
	$ ./getwer.sh > log.txt
	You will get WER for your files in log.txt

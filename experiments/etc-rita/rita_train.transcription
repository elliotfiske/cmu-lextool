SIL_COMMA AND FURTHER APOLOGY WOULD BE ABSURD SIL_FULLSTOP SIL_DOUBLEQUOTE I HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN HERTFORDSHIRE SIL_COMMA BEFORE I SAW SIL_COMMA IN COMMON WITH OTHERS SIL_COMMA THAT BINGLEY PREFERRED YOUR ELDER SISTER TO ANY OTHER YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY SIL_FULLSTOP BUT IT WAS NOT TILL THE EVENING OF THE DANCE AT NETHERFIELD THAT I HAD ANY APPREHENSION OF HIS FEELING A SERIOUS ATTACHMENT SIL_FULLSTOP I HAD OFTEN SEEN HIM IN LOVE BEFORE SIL_FULLSTOP AT THAT BALL SIL_COMMA WHILE I HAD THE HONOUR OF DANCING WITH YOU SIL_COMMA I WAS FIRST MADE ACQUAINTED SIL_COMMA BY SIR WILLIAM LUCAS'S

THE TIME ALONE COULD BE UNDECIDED SIL_FULLSTOP FROM THAT MOMENT I OBSERVED MY FRIEND'S BEHAVIOUR ATTENTIVELY SIL_SEMICOLON AND I COULD THEN PERCEIVE THAT HIS PARTIALITY FOR MISS BENNET WAS BEYOND WHAT I HAD EVER WITNESSED IN HIM SIL_FULLSTOP YOUR SISTER I ALSO WATCHED SIL_FULLSTOP HER LOOK AND MANNERS WERE OPEN SIL_COMMA CHEERFUL SIL_COMMA AND ENGAGING AS EVER SIL_COMMA BUT WITHOUT ANY SYMPTOM OF PECULIAR REGARD SIL_COMMA AND I REMAINED CONVINCED FROM THE EVENING'S SCRUTINY SIL_COMMA THAT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED HIS ATTENTIONS WITH PLEASURE SIL_COMMA SHE DID NOT INVITE THEM BY ANY PARTICIPATION OF SENTIMENT SIL_FULLSTOP IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN MISTAKEN HERE SIL_COMMA I MUST HAVE BEEN IN ERROR SIL_FULLSTOP YOUR SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR SISTER MUST MAKE THE LATTER PROBABLE SIL_FULLSTOP IF IT BE SO SIL_COMMA IF I HAVE BEEN MISLED BY SUCH ERROR TO INFLICT PAIN ON HER SIL_COMMA YOUR RESENTMENT HAS NOT BEEN UNREASONABLE SIL_FULLSTOP BUT I SHALL NOT SCRUPLE TO ASSERT SIL_COMMA THAT THE SERENITY OF YOUR SISTER'S COUNTENANCE AND AIR WAS SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE GIVEN THE MOST ACUTE OBSERVER A CONVICTION THAT SIL_COMMA HOWEVER AMIABLE HER TEMPER SIL_COMMA HER HEART WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE EASILY TOUCHED SIL_FULLSTOP THAT I WAS DESIROUS OF BELIEVING HER INDIFFERENT IS CERTAIN BUT I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THAT MY INVESTIGATION AND DECISIONS ARE NOT USUALLY INFLUENCED BY MY HOPES OR FEARS SIL_FULLSTOP I DID NOT BELIEVE HER TO BE INDIFFERENT BECAUSE I WISHED IT SIL_SEMICOLON I BELIEVED IT ON IMPARTIAL CONVICTION SIL_COMMA AS TRULY AS I WISHED IT IN REASON SIL_FULLSTOP MY OBJECTIONS TO THE MARRIAGE WERE NOT MERELY THOSE WHICH I LAST NIGHT ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE THE UTMOST FORCE OF PASSION TO PUT ASIDE SIL_COMMA IN MY OWN CASE SIL_SEMICOLON THE WANT OF CONNECTION COULD NOT BE SO GREAT AN EVIL TO MY FRIEND AS TO ME SIL_FULLSTOP BUT THERE WERE OTHER CAUSES OF REPUGNANCE SIL_SEMICOLON CAUSES WHICH SIL_COMMA THOUGH STILL EXISTING SIL_COMMA AND EXISTING TO AN EQUAL DEGREE IN BOTH INSTANCES SIL_COMMA I HAD MYSELF ENDEAVOURED TO DOT ORGET SIL_COMMA BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE ME SIL_FULLSTOP THESE CAUSES MUST BE STATED SIL_COMMA THOUGH BRIEFLY SIL_FULLSTOP THE SITUATION OF YOUR MOTHER'S FAMILY SIL_COMMA THOUGH OBJECTIONABLE SIL_COMMA WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON TO THAT TOTAL WANT OF PROPRIETY SO FREQUENTLY SIL_COMMA SO ALMOST UNIFORMLY BETRAYED BY HERSELF SIL_COMMA BY YOUR THREE YOUNGER SISTERS SIL_COMMA AND OCCASIONALLY EVEN BY YOUR FATHER SIL_FULLSTOP PARDON ME SIL_FULLSTOP IT PAINS ME TO OFFEND YOU SIL_FULLSTOP BUT AMIDST YOUR CONCERN FOR THE DEFECTS OF YOUR NEAREST RELATIONS SIL_COMMA AND YOUR DISPLEASURE AT THIS REPRESENTATION OF THEM SIL_COMMA LET IT GIVE YOU CONSOLATION TO CONSIDER THAT SIL_COMMA TO HAVE CONDUCTED YOURSELVES SO AS TO AVOID ANY SHARE OF THE LIKE CENSURE SIL_COMMA IS PRAISE NO LESS GENERALLY BESTOWED ON YOU AND YOUR ELDER SISTER SIL_COMMA THAN IT IS HONOURABLE TO THE SENSE AND DISPOSITION OF BOTH SIL_FULLSTOP I WILL ONLY SAY FARTHER THAT FROM WHAT PASSED THAT EVENING SIL_COMMA MY OPINION OF ALL PARTIES WAS CONFIRMED SIL_COMMA AND EVERY INDUCEMENT HEIGHTENED WHICH COULD HAVE LED ME BEFORE SIL_COMMA TO PRESERVE MY FRIEND FROM WHAT I ESTEEMED A MOST UNHAPPY CONNECTION SIL_FULLSTOP HE LEFT NETHERFIELD FOR LONDON SIL_COMMA ON THE DAY FOLLOWING SIL_COMMA AS YOU SIL_COMMA I AM CERTAIN SIL_COMMA REMEMBER SIL_COMMA WITH THE DESIGN OF SOON RETURNING SIL_FULLSTOP SIL_DOUBLEQUOTE THE PART WHICH I ACTED IS NOW TO BE EXPLAINED SIL_FULLSTOP HIS SISTERS SIL_SINGLEQUOTE UNEASINESS HAD BEEN EQUALLY EXCITED WITH MY OWN SIL_SEMICOLON OUR COINCIDENCE OF FEELING WAS SOON DISCOVERED SIL_COMMA AND SIL_COMMA ALIKE SENSIBLE THAT NO TIME WAS TO BE LOST IN DETACHING THEIR BROTHER SIL_COMMA WE SHORTLY RESOLVED ON JOINING HIM DIRECTLY IN LONDON SIL_FULLSTOP WE ACCORDINGLY WENT AND THERE I READILY ENGAGED IN THE OFFICE OF POINTING OUT TO MY FRIEND THE CERTAIN EVILS OF SUCH A CHOICE SIL_FULLSTOP I DESCRIBED SIL_COMMA AND ENFORCED THEM EARNESTLY SIL_FULLSTOP BUT SIL_COMMA HOWEVER THIS REMONSTRANCE MIGHT HAVE STAGGERED OR DELAYED HIS DETERMINATION SIL_COMMA I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT IT WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE PREVENTED THE MARRIAGE SIL_COMMA HAD IT NOT BEEN SECONDED BY THE ASSURANCE THAT I HESITATED NOT IN GIVING SIL_COMMA OF YOUR SISTER'S INDIFFERENCE SIL_FULLSTOP HE HAD BEFORE BELIEVED HER TO RETURN HIS AFFECTION WITH SINCERE SIL_COMMA IF NOT WITH EQUAL REGARD SIL_FULLSTOP BUT BINGLEY HAS GREAT NATURAL MODESTY SIL_COMMA WITH A STRONGER DEPENDENCE ON MY JUDGEMENT THAN ON HIS OWN SIL_FULLSTOP TO CONVINCE HIM SIL_COMMA THEREFORE SIL_COMMA THAT HE HAD DECEIVED HIMSELF SIL_COMMA WAS NO VERY DIFFICULT POINT SIL_FULLSTOP TO PERSUADE HIM AGAINST RETURNING INTO HERTFORDSHIRE SIL_COMMA WHEN THAT CONVICTION HAD BEEN GIVEN SIL_COMMA WAS SCARCELY THE WORK OF A MOMENT SIL_FULLSTOP I CANNOT BLAME MYSELF FOR HAVING DONE THUS MUCH SIL_FULLSTOP THERE IS BUT ONE PART OF MY CONDUCT IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR ON WHICH I DO NOT REFLECT

TO MISS BINGLEY SIL_SEMICOLON BUT HER BROTHER IS EVEN YET IGNORANT OF IT SIL_FULLSTOP THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE MET WITHOUT ILL CONSEQUENCE IS PERHAPS PROBABLE SIL_SEMICOLON BUT HIS REGARD DID NOT APPEAR TO ME ENOUGH EXTINGUISHED FOR HIM TO SEE HER WITHOUT SOME DANGER SIL_FULLSTOP PERHAPS THIS CONCEALMENT SIL_COMMA THIS DISGUISE WAS BENEATH ME SIL_SEMICOLON IT IS DONE SIL_COMMA HOWEVER SIL_COMMA AND IT WAS DONE FOR THE BEST SIL_FULLSTOP ON THIS SUBJECT I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY SIL_COMMA NO OTHER APOLOGY TO OFFER SIL_FULLSTOP IF I HAVE WOUNDED YOUR SISTER'S FEELINGS SIL_COMMA IT WAS UNKNOWINGLY DONE AND THOUGH THE MOTIVES WHICH GOVERNED ME MAY TO YOU VERY NATURALLY APPEAR INSUFFICIENT SIL_COMMA I HAVE NOT YET LEARNT TO CONDEMN THEM SIL_FULLSTOP SIL_DOUBLEQUOTE WITH RESPECT TO THAT OTHER SIL_COMMA MORE WEIGHTY ACCUSATION SIL_COMMA OF HAVING INJURED MR. WICKHAM SIL_COMMA I CAN ONLY REFUTE IT BY LAYING BEFORE YOU THE WHOLE OF HIS CONNECTION WITH MY FAMILY SIL_FULLSTOP OF WHAT HE HAS PARTICULARLY ACCUSED ME I AM IGNORANT SIL_SEMICOLON BUT OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT I SHALL RELATE SIL_COMMA I CAN SUMMON MORE THAN ONE WITNESS OF UNDOUBTED VERACITY SIL_FULLSTOP SIL_DOUBLEQUOTE MR.
